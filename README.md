# Better Ability Bar
A mod for Caves of Qud, available on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1497718805).

## Description
**Now requires [Harmony Injector](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1625698528)!**
**Support for _HarmonyShim_ has been dropped!**

Changes the abilities bar at the top of the screen to be more useful. Cooldowns will now always be clearly visible and your most commonly used abilities will be given priority to remind you to make use of them.

It re-sorts abilities in the following order:
1) Abilities on cooldown.
2) Your most recently/commonly used abilities.
3) Other abilities.
4) Toggled abilities.

**Backup your save files!**

This mod stores information about skill usage in the save file, so removing this mod will flag any save games you made while playing with it as corrupted!

## Requirements
Caves of Qud needs to be configured to use the Unity Overlay UI for this mod to be useful.

This mod requires [Harmony Injector](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1625698528) to function.

*Previous support for HarmonyShim has been dropped from this version onward.*
