{"workshopId":1497718805,"Title":"Better Ability Bar","Description":"Changes the abilities bar at the top of the screen to be more useful. Cooldowns will now always be clearly visible and your most commonly used abilties will be given priority to remind you to make use of them.\r\n\r\nIt resorts abilities in the following order:\r\n1) Abilities on cooldown.\r\n2) Your most recently/commonly used abilities.\r\n3) Other abilities.\r\n4) Toggled abiltiies.\r\n\r\nThis mod requires the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1497685893]Harmony Shim mod[/url] to function.  While it is installed, your game may suddenly quit-to-desktop when you install/uninstall mods in the future (usually when leaving the mod configuration screen).  This is normal; just restart the game and it will be ready to play.\r\n\r\nThis mod stores information about skill usage in the save file, so removing this mod will flag any save games you made while playing with it as corrupted! Backup your save files!","Tags":"UI, Abilities, Quality of Life","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
